### Requirements
For further reference, please consider the following sections

### Project structure (Packages)
The project has been done following Hexagonal Architecture and CQRS.

The main packages are:
- [application](src%2Fmain%2Fkotlin%2Fcom%2Fvolkswagen%2Ftechchallenge%2Fapplication)
  <br /> Bla bla bla
- [domain](src%2Fmain%2Fkotlin%2Fcom%2Fvolkswagen%2Ftechchallenge%2Fdomain)
  <br /> Bla bla bla
- [infrastructure](src%2Fmain%2Fkotlin%2Fcom%2Fvolkswagen%2Ftechchallenge%2Finfrastructure)
  <br /> Bla bla bla
- [config](src%2Fmain%2Fkotlin%2Fcom%2Fvolkswagen%2Ftechchallenge%2Fconfig)
  <br /> Bla bla bla
- [common](src%2Fmain%2Fkotlin%2Fcom%2Fvolkswagen%2Fcommon)
  <br />This represents all stuff that should be common to several microservices following the same patterns.
  <br />In this case it contains the interfaces to work with CQRS in a tidy way.
